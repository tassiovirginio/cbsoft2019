        <p>The Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice (CBSoft) is an annual event promoted by the
          Brazilian Computer Society (SBC), aiming at promoting and encouraging the exchange of experiences among
          researchers and practioneers from the industry and academia on the latest research, trends and innovations –
          practical and theoretical – concerning software. Held since 2010, CBSoft has become one of the most important
          events of the Brazilian scientific computing community, and each year the numbers of submissions of
          scientific papers and participants have been increasing.</p>
        <p>CBSoft 2018 integrates four traditional events organized by the Brazilian software development community:</p>
        <p>XXXII Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES 2018) XXII Brazilian Symposium on Programming
          Languages (SBLP 2018) XII Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures and Software Reuse (SBCARS 2018)
          III Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST 2018)</p>
        <p>The conference includes technical sessions, national and international keynotes, panels, tutorials and short
          courses. In 2018, the 9th edition of CBSoft will be held in São Carlos/SP, considered as the national capital
          of technology (Law No. 20504, 2011). The responsibility of organizing the event will be under the Institute
          of Mathematics and Computer Sciences at University of São Paulo (ICMC/USP), the Federal University of São
          Carlos (UFSCAR) and the Federal Institute of São Paulo at São Carlos (IFSP/São Carlos).</p>
