The Brazilian Conference on Software: Theory and Practice (CBSoft) is an annual event promoted by the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC), aiming at promoting and encouraging the exchange of experiences among researchers and practioneers from the industry and academia on the latest research, trends and innovations – practical and theoretical – concerning software. Held since 2010, CBSoft has become one of the most important events of the Brazilian scientific computing community, and each year the numbers of submissions of scientific papers and participants have been increasing.

CBSoft 2019 integrates four traditional events organized by the Brazilian software development community: XXXIII Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES 2019) XXIII Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages (SBLP 2019) XIII Brazilian Symposium on Components, Architectures and Software Reuse (SBCARS 2019) IV Brazilian Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST 2019)

The conference includes technical sessions, national and international keynotes, panels, tutorials and short courses. In 2019, the 10th edition of CBSoft will be held in Salvador/BA.

We look forward to seeing you all in Salvador, between September 23rd and 27th, 2019!
