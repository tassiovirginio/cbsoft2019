## CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE

The IX Workshop on Theses and Dissertations of CBSoft (WTDSoft 2019) is a
permanent event associated with the Brazilian Congress on Software: Theory
and Practice (CBSoft), dedicated to the presentation and discussion of
master&#39;s and doctoral works in progress in the areas of Software
Engineering and Programming Languages. The CBSoft 2019 will be held in
Salvador-BA, September 23-27, 2019.

## THE WORKSHOP

CBSoft was created in 2010 to integrate important Brazilian scientific
events, such as: Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES),
Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages ​​(SBLP), Brazilian Symposium
on Software Components, Architectures, and Reuse (SBCARS), and Brazilian
Symposium on Systematic and Automated Software Testing (SAST).
WTDSoft has its roots in the Workshop on Theses and Dissertations in
Software Engineering (WTES), an event co-located with SBES from 1996 to
2010. WTDSoft currently seeks to integrate the SBES, SBLP, SBCARS and SAST
communities, in order to provide a constructive environment for
discussions between students with work in progress and researchers in the
areas of Software Engineering and Programming Languages.

## ELIGIBILITY AND EVALUATION

Masters or doctoral works are eligible for submission, preferably:
- Doctoral work with a defined proposal (not necessarily approved)
- Masters work with an approved proposal (desirable, but not mandatory) and expected deadline after December 2019
- Works that have not been accepted or presented in other workshops on theses and dissertations.

The works will be evaluated and selected by the program committee. Each paper will receive a feedback from the committee with questions and suggestions about its content. These comments should be used by the author in the preparation of the paper’s final version. Selected papers will be presented and discussed during WTDSoft, with program committee members and invited researchers. Acceptance of the work implies the author&#39;s registration in WTDSoft (and also in CBSoft) and his/her presence for the presentation of the work. The presentation may be in Portuguese or English. We assume that the author is the graduate student responsible for the development of the thesis or dissertation.
